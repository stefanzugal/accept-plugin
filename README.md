# Redmine Accept Plugin
People having worked with TRAC are used to "accept" issues, which basically states that someone will now actively work on a specific issue. Redmine apparently also supports custom issue statuses, such as "accepted", but it requires more than one click to accept an issue (edit issue, select status "accepted", select assignee). This plugin allows to accept tickets with one click.

To repeat, because it appears to be misleading: That is the one and only purpose of this plugin: to state with one click that "I am now working on this issue". That's it - nothing more than that.

### Installation Notes
The plugin can be installed as ordinary redmine plugin (compatible with redmine 4.0.x, 3.4.x, 3.3.x, 3.2.x, 3.1.x, 3.0.x, 2.6.x.) and does not require database migration:
* Create directory your_redmine_base/plugins/accept
* Copy the content of this repository to the created directory. If you are cloning from this repository, please make sure to rename the root folder from "accept-plugin" to "accept" to match the described folder structure above. Otherwise, you will experience errors as described in [#8](../../issues/8). 
* Restart redmine (e.g., through "touch your_redmine_base/tmp/restart.txt")
* The accept plugin needs to know which issue status is considered as "accepted" in your redmine installation. By default, the first status is considered the "accepted" status. This behaviour can be configured in your redmine installation: Administration --> Plugins --> Accept Plugin --> Configure

### Things Good to Know

* From version 0.0.2, it is possible to define the accept status per tracker. This means, depending on the tracker the issue is assigned to, a different accept status may be selected. If you do not wish to have a different accept status for each tracker, it is still possible to configure a common accept state for all trackers.
* The accept button does not show up. Why?
  * The accept button will only show up if you are listed in the combo box with "Assigned to".
  * If the issue is already closed, the button will not show up.
  * If you have already accepted the issue - meaning that the issue is already in the defined accept state, the button will not show up.


### Version History

[0.0.3](../../releases/tag/0.0.3)
* Fixed issue with saving tracker settings that have special characters (see [#12](../../issues/12)). The new code will now store the status using the tracker's id - so when you have configured the "accept status per role", please back-up your settings and re-insert them after the upgrade, since there is no automated migration.

[0.0.2](../../releases/tag/0.0.2)
* Allows the accept status to be dependent on the tracker the issue is assigned to, see [#5](../../issues/5). 

[0.0.1](../../releases/tag/0.0.1)
 * First version of the plugin.
